Designed to keep a track of  internal operations and data collection of the patient.


Human Health Database Schema

üìë About the project

This repository provides a MySQL DDL script that builds the Human_health relational database‚Äîan opinionated data model for managing comprehensive clinical, administrative, and lifestyle information about patients.

The schema is designed for clinics, research teams, or health‚Äìtech‚ÄØstart‚Äëups that need an extensible and referentially‚Äëintact data store covering everything from demographics and vitals to surgical history and daily‚Äëliving metrics.

Tip: All foreign‚Äëkey relationships use ON UPDATE NO ACTION / ON DELETE NO ACTION to enforce integrity without cascading deletes.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

MySQL¬†8.0+ (or compatible MariaDB version)

MySQL Workbench or command‚Äëline access

üöÄ Installation

# 1. Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/<your‚Äëorg>/human_health_db.git
$ cd human_health_db

# 2. Log in to MySQL and run the script
mysql¬†‚Äëu <user>¬†‚Äëp < human_health_schema.sql

# or import via MySQL Workbench > File¬†¬ª Run SQL¬†Script‚Ä¶

The script will:

Create the Human_health schema.

Build all tables and indexes.

Establish primary‚Äë & foreign‚Äëkey constraints.

Note: The circular relationship between Teams, FMD, and HCC is resolved automatically by MySQL‚Äôs deferred FK parsing during the same session.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Quick start usage

-- List all active patients
SELECT MRN, First_Name, Last_Name, DOB
FROM Human_health.Patients;

-- Fetch latest vitals for a patient
SELECT *
FROM Human_health.Vitals
WHERE Patients_MRN = 1234
ORDER BY Vital_date DESC
LIMIT 1;

Feel free to extend the schema with views, stored procedures, or ORMs as suits your stack.
